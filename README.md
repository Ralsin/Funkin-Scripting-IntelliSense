# FunkinLua Autocomplete (WORK IN PROGRESS)
Very silly VSCode extension that was made as a better alternative to the already existing "Funkin Script Autocomplete".  
It's written completely from scratch, so any complains like "stolen" and "no credits" will be ignored since it's invalid.
## Features
- Faster loading
- Accurate documentation info
- Useful built-in snippets like `For-Notes Loop` and `lerp` function
## Current docs
- Psych Engine
  - 0.6.3 (WIP)
## Planned:
- hscript support (using `.hscript` files)
